## 📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced Docker image management techniques, focusing on layer manipulation and size optimization. Through practical implementation, I explored Docker's Union File System (UFS), image layering mechanics, and strategies for efficient container image management. The project showcases real-world approaches to understanding and controlling Docker image sizes while maintaining functionality.

## 🎯 Key Objectives

- Master Docker image layer architecture and their impact on overall image size
- Implement practical techniques for Docker image size optimization
- Understand the implications of Union File System on image modifications
- Develop expertise in Docker commit operations and layer management
- Gain hands-on experience with container modification and image versioning
